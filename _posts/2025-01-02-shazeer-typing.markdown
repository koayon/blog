There aren't very many people as accomplished in language modelling as Noam Shazeer.

Shazeer invented MoEs, Multihead Attention, Multiquery Attention,
Tensor-Parallel LLM Training, SwiGLU and co-invented the Transformer.
In 2021, after Google's slowness to release LLM technology,
Shazeer left Google to found Character.AI[^google].
This ended a string of incredibly insight research papers and since joining Character Shazeer has released only 4 blog posts about research.
Three are on the Character blog [here](https://research.character.ai/) about efficient inference and prompting.
But the last is a curious tiny post on what he calls [Shape Suffixes](https://medium.com/@NoamShazeer/shape-suffixes-good-coding-style-f836e72e24fd) and
we refer to as `Shazeer typing`.
The post is 114 words and a single code block but I've found it
remarkably useful in writing better PyTorch code.

Let's get into it.

[^google]: Shazeer is now back at Google to lead the Gemini team following a $2.7B Inflection-style acqui-hire.
It's not _quite_ true that Google spent $2.7B to hire one researcher,
but it's not _not_ true ðŸ¤·


## Core Idea

### The Problem

When writing ML code, we need to understand what each tensor represents, what each dimensions represents and the shapes of the dimensions. For example if some matrix represents a linear transformation from space X to space Y, then this is useful information to know.

There have been some other more heavyweight approaches to this: I used to use jaxtyping which checks tensor shapes but you only see the shape when a tensor is introduced and jaxtyping is fairly verbose.

### The Solution

The **Shazeer typing** system is much simpler and more lightweight:

- Designate a system of single-letter names for logical dimensions, e.g. `B` for batch size, `S` for sequence length, etc., and document it somewhere in your file/project/codebase
- When known, the name of a tensor should end in a dimension-suffix composed of those letters, e.g. tokens_BS represents a two-dimensional tensor with batch and seq_length dimensions.

You can then write an MLP as (in pseudocode):

```python

""" Example MLP torch pseudocode code with Shazeer typing.
For illustration purposes only.

Dimension key:

B: batch_size
S: seq_len (sequence length)
N: neuron_dim (sometimes called model dimension, d_model or embedding_dim)
V: vocab_size (vocabulary size)
F: feature_dim (feed-forward subnetwork hidden size)
"""

class MLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_dim: int, out_dim: int):
        super().__init__()

        self.W_in_NF = nn.Parameter(t.zeros(out_dim, in_dim))
        self.W_out_FN =  nn.Parameter(t.zeros(in_dim, out_dim))

        self.init_params()

    def forward(self, x_BSN: t.Tensor) -> t.Tensor:
        y_BSF = x_BSN @ self.W_in_NF
        y_BSF = t.gelu(y_BSF)
        out_BSN = y_BSF @ self.W_out_FN

        return out_BSN
```

Note that from just looking at this we can immediately see that we won't have any share errors:
all the shapes match up for our matrix multiplications.
And it's pretty clear what each tensor represents.

Shazeer typing is an excellent lesson in following the [Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/). It tracks with:

> Explicit is better than implicit.
>
> Simple is better than complex.
>
> Readability counts.
>
> Practicality beats purity.
>
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
>
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

We also get all the benefits of using type signatures for clarity without the headache of being ultra precise with types.
In Python types are for communication with humans not for communicating with the compiler[^compiler], so it's better to optimise for readability.

[^compiler]: The compiler ignores your type hints anyways.
