Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kola, an ML Researcher based in London, UK.
This is my technical blog about Machine Learning.

My current main research interests are:

1. Mechanistic Interpretability - broadly defined as the study of reverse
   engineering neural networks from the learned weights into human-interpretable
   algorithms.
   - Iâ€™m particularly interested in universal representation learning (and its
     philosophical implications), compositional representations and principled
     approaches to feature disentanglement.
2. Theories of Agency
   - I'm particularly Active Inference and Bayesian Mechanics as candidates for unified theories of agency which we can use as models for agency at different levels of abstraction.
3. Adaptive Neural Computation
   - I'm especially interested in approaches which allow networks to spend more
     compute on difficult tokens via early-exiting mechanisms, MoE and related
     approaches.
   - I maintain an
     [annotated collection of research papers](https://github.com/koayon/awesome-adaptive-computation)
     in Adaptive Computation for the community.
4. Modularity in Neural Networks
   - I'm interested in how we can understand the inherent modularity in neural networks in the wild.
   - I'm also interested in lessons about multi-task learning and generalisation from designed modular architectures.

Previous research interests have included the Linguistic properties of
Mathematics, ML applied to Musicology and Logic.
