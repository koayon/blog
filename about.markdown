Hello! I'm Kola! I'm a ML Researcher based in London, UK.

<!-- I currently work at Unlikely AI, an AI
lab taking a novel approach to building safe, trustworthy and powerful
Artificial Intelligence. -->

This is my technical blog about Machine Learning.

My main current research interests are:

1. Adaptive Neural Computation
   - I'm especially interested in approaches which allow networks to spend more
     compute on difficult tokens via early-exiting mechanisms, MoE and related
     approaches.
   - I maintain an
     [annotated collection of research papers](https://github.com/koayon/awesome-adaptive-computation)
     in Adaptive Computation for the community.
2. Mechanistic Interpretability - broadly defined as the study of reverse
   engineering neural networks from the learned weights into human-interpretable
   algorithms.
   - Iâ€™m particularly interested in universal representation learning (and its
     philosophical implications), automated interpretability and
     compositionality.
3. Computational reasoning
   - This can often overlap with either Adaptive Computation, search-based
     methods and neurosymbolic approaches to computation. I'm also interested in
     automated theorem proving and code generation as playgrounds for general
     reasoning capabilities.

<!-- 4. Modularity in Neural Networks
   - When -->

Previous research interests have included the Linguistic properties of
Mathematics, ML applied to Musicology and Logic.
